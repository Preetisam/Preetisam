Hi ðŸ‘‹ !
Kamilla Preeti Samuel
I enjoy problem-solving and coding.
I love solving questions on LeetCode and doing competitive programming.
I am well-versed in Computer Science fundamentals like OOPS, Operating Systems, and Database Management Systems and I also have a keen interest in High-Level System Design. 
I have built a few projects on Web Development using Express, ReactJS, Node.js, and App Development. 
I am passionate about developing complex applications that solve real-world problems impacting millions of users.
I always strive to bring 100% to the work I do.
